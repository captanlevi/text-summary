# Text Summarization
Here I have implemented and trained a text sumarization model, using a LSTM encoder-decoder model. The dacoding was done with an attention layer. The code is written in pytorch.
I have used the [amazon review dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/currie32/summarizing-text-with-amazon-reviews) for training and evaluating my model.  
The dataset contains long text reviews and their summary pairs.
